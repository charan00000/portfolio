        <h1>HydroTerra</h1>
        <p>HydroTerra is a small 3D word game in which the player guides a moving letter of the alphabet through a set of tracks in order to place the letter in one of five slots. Upon slot placement, another letter is generated from the top of the track course, and the player repeats the process. The player's goal is to spell out as many words as possible by placing letters in the appropriate spots.</p>
