        <h1>Arctic Polar Bear & Bearded Seal Population Modeling</h1>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This is an implementation & exploration of an application of a modified version of the Lotka-Volterra equations to model animal populations, specifically those that exhibit cannibalistic behavior. This repo supplements a paper as part of a project for a class (GT Math 2552). </p>
        <p>We implement a variation of the Volterra equations as provided by ecologist C.S. Holling, which models two animal species which both exhibit cannibalistic behavior.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We start off by re-solving and analyzing the use of the equations through the example provided by Holling involving tiger salamanders and crab spiders.</li>
            <li>We then solve the equations using polar bear & bearded seal data sourced from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (2019).</li>
            <li>Generates Euler phase portrats in order to find convergence patterns</li>
            <li>Generates population v. time graph in order to find convergence, which is overlayed over collected data to measure extrapolation performance. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>MatPlotLib</li>
            <li>Pandas</li>
        </ul>
